1. Follow the steps in the youtube video to install postgres (https://youtu.be/qw--VYLpxG4 @ 10:55)
	- suppose your set up password is <password>

2. Log in to the postgres terminal, and execute the db_setup_commands.sql
	In the postgres terminal, write the command '\i <file path db_setup_commands.sql>'
	This will set up the database along with its mock values.
	This may take a few seconds for file to be parsed through, and then a lot of creates and inserts will happen

	Note: If you are on windows, you will have to change al the backslashes '\' in the file path to forward
	slashes '/'. This is a special requirement for the postgres terminal

3. Load the files from the repo into your visual studio project

5. In db_connect.js, change the password field (line 15) to your set up password

6. All done, the mapping to the index has already been done.
	Perform a test call using GET http://localhost:8000/meditrack/test
	This will return the information for the first user in the system (Todd Peters)
