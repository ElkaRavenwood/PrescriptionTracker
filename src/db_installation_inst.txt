	- suppose your set up password is <password>

2. Log in to the postgres terminal, and execute the db_setup_commands.sql
	In the postgres terminal, write the command '\i <file path db_setup_commands.sql>'
	This will set up the database along with its mock values.
	This may take a few seconds for file to be parsed through, and then a lot of creates and inserts will happen

3. Load the files from the repo into your visual studio project

4. Install the pg library using $ npm install --save pg

5. In db_connect.js, change the password field (line 15) to your set up password
